# Meeting 11 - 22th of August 2022

## Disscussing the names

uspan / mspan -> collision with privilege levels

Mark is warning us that it will probably be changed down the line -> name is not so important.
Current name switched to Microarchitecture Side-Channel Resistant Instruction Spans Task Group (uSCR-IS TG)

## Spawning the TG

Check the process followed by AP-TEE cf Ravi Sahita.

## Charter modification

- bullets for deliverable
- for ISA -> work with appropriate priv or unpriv, are we aiming for an ISA fast-track ?
- change the term "application" -> broader term needed
- "isolation constrains" -> isolation properties ?

## Performance counters are an issue

Not in scope -> see with Security HC
